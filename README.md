# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game! A game of chance where you get to test your decicion-making skills and settle disputes against your opponent, the computer. This game is based on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game but with two additional elements: Lizard and Spock. A twist that adds a layer of complexity and ensures less ties as an outcome.

## Rules
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
