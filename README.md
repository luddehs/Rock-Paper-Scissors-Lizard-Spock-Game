# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game! A game of chance where you get to test your decicion-making skills and settle disputes against your opponent, the computer. This game is based on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game but with two additional elements: Lizard and Spock. A twist that adds a layer of complexity and ensures less ties as an outcome.

### Rules
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock

## Site Owner Goals

- To provide a user friendly game which lets the user enjoy simple game mechanics.
- To present an appealing design on a fully responsive website.
- To encourage the user to win over the computer by making a decision between rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock.
- To create a sense of competition between the user and the computer through interactive messages.


## User Stories

- ### First Time User

- ### Returning user

- ### Frequent user


## Design

### Imagery

### Colour Scheme

### Fonts
I use the Cabin Sketch font as the main font throughout the website, giving headlines and titles consistency with playfully bold lettering. 
Nanum Brush Script is applied as a secondary font to areas where text is frequently updated, making text appear to be written out, and on lists where smaller text-size is required. All fonts were imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Sans Serif is used as a backup if for any reason the main font won't load correctly.

### Layout
The site is a single page with 8 sections:
  - Header
  - Rules toggle area
  - Game area
  - Outcome message
  - Player/computer choice images
  - Score area
  - Reset game
  - Footer

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq as a tool to create the wireframes.
